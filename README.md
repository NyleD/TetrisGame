# Extreme Super-Fun Quadris 9000!

Extreme Super-Fun!?
What is a Quadris anyway?
Where did the 9000 come from?

Let us break it down for you.

Extreme Super-Fun Quadris 9000 is a super-secret limited edition Tetris clone, 
built and designed by a small group of overtired/caffeine-addicted CS undergrads.
Quadris is identical to Tetris except that it's turn-based. It's played by typing 
commands into your terminal. How retro!

So why is Quadris EXTREME SUPER-FUN!? Well, the blocks don't move down after a row 
is cleared, making the game extra challenging and excercising your brain in a new 
and exciting way.

The 9000? That's how many minutes it felt like we spent debugging... 

Enjoy!
